# Orthogonalization

Machine learning implies on the following chain of assumptions:

Fitting the [[training set]] well on the cost function => fitting the [[cross-validation set|dev set]] well on the cost function => fitting the [[test set]] well on the cost function => performing well in practice.

Orthogonalization refers to the idea that one wants different [[hyperparameter|hyperparameters]] to tune for each goal/criterion.
