# End-to-end deep learning

Replacing several steps by a single [[00 - neural networks|neural network]] is called *end-to-end deep learning.*

The advantages of end-to-end deep learning are that it lets the data speak (rather than reflecting human preconceptions) and needs less hand-designing of components.

The disadvantages are that it may need a large amount of data and excludes potentially useful hand-designed components.

The key question is whether there is enough data to learn a function of the complexity needed to map x to y.
