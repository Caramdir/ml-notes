# Variance

The *variance* or *second central moment* of a random variable $X$ is
$$
	\sigma_X^2 = \mathbb E\bigl[(X-\mathbb E[X])^2\bigr].
$$
That is, it is the expected squared deviation from the [[mean|mean]]. It is equal to the self-[[covariance]] $\operatorname{Cov}[X,X]$.

The *standard deviation* $\sigma_X$ is the root of the variance.
