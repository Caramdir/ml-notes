# Pearson correlation coefficient
The *Pearson correlation coefficient* is the normalized [[covariance]]:
$$
	\rho_{X,Y} = \frac{\operatorname{Cov}[X,Y]}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y},
$$
where $\operatorname{Cov}[X,Y]$ is the covariance and $\sigma_X$ and $\sigma_Y$ are the [[Mathematical background/variance|standard deviations]].
