# tanh

The tanh functions is
$$
	\tanh(z) = \frac{e^z-e^{-z}}{e^z + e^{-z}}
$$
with derivative
$$
	\tanh'(z) = 1 - \tanh^2(z).
$$

[TODO: Add plot.]

The $\tanh$ function usually works better as a [[nonlinearity]] in a [[00 - neural networks|neural network]], as it has $0$ mean, making learing for the next layer easier. [Reference?]
