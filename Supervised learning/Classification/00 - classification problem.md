# Classification problems

[[00 - supervised learning]] problems where the output is a discrete variable.

## Binary classification problems

The output variable can only take on two possible values, usually normalized to $y \in \{0,\,1\}$.

### Algorithms

- [[logistic regression]]
- [[support vector machine|Support vector machine]]

## Multiclass classification problems

The output variable is allowed to take on values from a discrete set.

- [[one-vs-all algorithm]] turns any binary classifier into a multi-class classifier
