# Unsupervised learning

Given an unlabeled data set, find some structure in the data.

An example is [[00 - clustering]].

Another example is the cocktail party problem: Given several speakers and several microphone recordings (from different places), separate out the speakers.

## Unsupervised learning problems
- [[00 - clustering]]
- [[dimensionality reduction]]
- [[anomality detection]]
