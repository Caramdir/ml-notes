# Dimensionality reduction

**Motivation 1:** Data compression

If there are non-independent features, we would like to remove them in order to reduce redundancy. More generally, we would like to replace several redundant features by a single new one.

**Motivation 2:** Data visualization

We can only plot 2D or 3D plots, so we would like to summarize all features in just two or three numbers.
