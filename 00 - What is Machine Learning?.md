# What is machine learning?

Learning without being explicitly programmed. (Samuel '59)

A well posed learning problem consists of (Mitchell '98):
- an expericence $E$,
- a task $T$,
- a performence measure $P$, measuring performance on $T$,
such that $P$ increases with $E$.

Types of learning are [[00 - supervised learning]] and [[00 - unsupervised learning]]. Other problems include [[00 - recommender system|recommender systems]].
