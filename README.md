# Notes on Machine Learning

Notes mostly taken when watching the  [Coursera course on machine learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome).

I am using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for writing and displaying these notes, but any markdown-based notataking app should give reasonable results.
